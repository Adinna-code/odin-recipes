<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A wholesome twist on the classic favorite chicken tenders. I personally would prefer these baked over fried any day!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>vegetable cooking spray (such as I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!Â®)</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups panko bread crumbs</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken tenders, cut into 1/2-inch strips lengthwise</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps to follow</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Place egg in a shallow dish. Place bread crumbs, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper into a large zip-top freezer bag and mix well. Dip 2 chicken strips into egg and then place into bread crumb mixture and shake to coat. Place coated chicken pieces onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
    <li>Spray each chicken tender with cooking spray 2 times.</li>
    <li>Bake tenders in the preheated oven for 7 minutes; flip, continue to bake on opposite side until no longer pink in the centers, about 7 minutes more. Remove from the oven.</li>
    <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
    <li>Broil tenders in the preheated oven for extra crunch, about 2 minutes more.</li>
</ol>
